BUGS
====

    Well, well, they must be there...


* gcc-3.x and later no longer accept multi-line string literals.
  Such strings are generated from tcl to C by the tcl2c.c converter.
  gcc-2.x or previous versions shoud be used.

* Bypass fader : should use the full volume level, while using faders
  reservs some volume for accents.
