	- bug fix in flam button, thanks to Gary Luebbert <gdluebbert@yahoo.com>

October 13, 2004
	- put copyright in all files
	- manage with cvs at savannah

November 27, 2002
	- alsa-9.x patches from http://www.alsa-project.org/~iwai/alsa.html

March 12, 2001 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- inline help from .texi to .help; browse in tcl :-)

March 9, 2001 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- fix the sizing problem.

March 5, 2001 Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>
	- port for next debian release; add unix manual; signal
the sizing problem when "X -dpi 75".

October 6, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- add pattern comments for score annotation: score is automatically
generated by a translator (tl2ly) from .dat file to .ly (for lilypond).
This translator in under progress and is not yet distributed.

September 13, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- add midi-play support for flam and accents.
Set the accent volume fader to 100 % by default.
	- change the note_play and note_test feeling: the sound
maintains while along the key is pressed and stop when it is released.
This is *especially* usefull for the Gravis & timidity MIDI environment
where whistles do not have some prescribed duration: 
whistle note never stoped !
	- change the Button-2-Motion meaning in the edit-map:
increment one-by-one midi-note instead of using the Y value.
Use also 1/2 second delay between each note change.
	- change the track clear from current position to end
from Atl-click CLEAR to Shift-Ctrl-click CLEAR: KDE uses Alt-click
for moving windows, and this command was not reachable when running KDE !


September 11, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- add midi_save flam & accent support.
Update documentation.


September 9, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- add read/write note properties (fla, accent,...) in .dat data file format
and edit clicks for that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version tk707-0.6
Changes since tk707-0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 11, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- fix an install bug in Makefile.am

September 7, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- version 0.6 released
        - add version handler using CVS and the VERSION file
for major version number. 
	- fix some configure flags for a (buggy) Mandrake Linux.


September 6, 2000 chris@vislab.usyd.edu.au
	- fix a bug when openning "~/.tk707rc" file at tart up
	- close the alsa-port selector as soon as the "Save" button
is pressed and an output port has been selected (rather than requiring
OK as well).
	- when done as root, make stopped because it couldn't find the "tcl2c"
program. This is because root don't have . in PATH
root. Referenced "tcl2c" as "./tcl2c" in the make process.


September 5, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- fix a minor bug: pattern copy/paste and copy merge
work also for groups patterns diferent than A :-)
	- add a default file name for saving .dat and .mid,
computed from last loaded .dat :-))
work also for groups patterns diferent than A !
	- work on a large demo: brazilian samba batucada (carioca),
that uses most of the features of TK-707. Big test !


September 4, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- version pre-0.6 released
	- update html pages for distribution.

September 3, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- I've just installed "timidity-1.10" as a alsa/midi server,
and I can hear the pattern-play mode...! So, the change of scales are
now played correctly in interactive mode : polyrythmies... The GUS
patches are handled by this server, and there is a link to the Gravis
sounds for the 727 patches. The sound is nice for gongas: hear the
file "son-montuno.dat" with the 727.map as demo.
	- add instrument abbreviations for volume labels (instead of instrument number),
The abbrev is also stored in .map files: load is backward compatible.
I have these abbrevs on the tk727, but I'am interesed to
get those for the 707; Neverthless, I put somes in the 707.map file.
	- some few C code hacks in order to compile with C++
	- use autoconf and automake: the installation is easier.
	- restructure the documentation, using Texinfo, and
update documentation for INSTALL and the scale feature: HTML and 
postscipt outputs are available.


September 1, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- adjust the general layout.  The widget hierarchy 
slighly is changed.
	- clean the score image, by using xfig.
The image generation from .fig uses "fig2dev -L pm" and "xv" with
the "autocrops" button. Is this feature in fig2dev ?
	- add the "turning lamps" on the left of the score, and
activated by the "scale" button.
	- change the felling of the tempo dial: use an angular 
dependence, associated to the circular mouvement of the mousse.


August 30, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- insert a score of decomposition by steps of the tempo
and add turning lamps on the left of the score, as on tk7x7
This interface is much more pretty.
Need to fix the layout of the interface: some buttons have moved...


August 26, 2000 pierre.saramito@imag.fr
	- fix a "midi save" bug : while {$step < 16} { ...
becomes after fix in .tcl       : while {$step < $last_step} { ...
	- add a "scale" field in "struct pattern_tag" and
a menu that set its value in 1..4 and update midi output and 
save file.dat output. Patterns with ternary decomposition are 
allowed: change the number of deltas per step : 384 = 3*128 when
saving on midi file.
Caution: The play function does not take it to account because I have no
midi sound card... sorry. I hear midi files accross "timidity" as a 
`midi2way' translator and then use "play file.midi"; so...later !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version tk707-0.5
Changes since tk707-0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mar 5, 2000
	- Create/Edit patterns directly from pattern display grid.
Double click near intersection of instrument & step to insert the
instrument at that step (or delete it if its already there). Must be
in pattern write mode of course.
	- Copy/Paste of patterns. Ctrl-c to copy current pattern, then
select another pattern and Ctrl-v or Ctrl-b to paste into new location.
Ctrl-v deletes prior contents of destination pattern while Ctrl-b
merges copied contents with prior contents of destination pattern.
Pasting is only enabled in pattern write mode, while copying is poosible
in any mode.

Mar 4, 2000
	- LAST STEP button now allows setting the number of steps in a pattern
so that the default (16) can be changed to a lesser value. This enables
unusual time signatures to be simulated, e.g. 7/4 is possible by following
a 16 step pattern with a 12 step pattern. Grouping of consecutive patterns
to make this easier isn't done yet.
	A new .dat file format is required to record the step lengths so
file writing has been changed, as has file reading (which reads old format
.dat files as well, in which case all step lengths are left at 16).

Mar 1, 2000
	- Added gui for selecting output client:port from those available
at startup. Input selection also but it doesn't do anything (yet).

Feb 27, 2000
	- Added gui for editing sound maps & put description into README file.

Feb 26, 2000
	- Added key_labels_reset so that key labels would change to correct
name when different sound map is loaded.
	- Included alternate sound map file (snd_727.map). Based on TR-707
sounds, although I don't know exactly which keys the sounds are supposed
to map to. This mapping won't work with a TR-707 (because there are no
sounds corresponding to the midi note values) but works with D-110 module.
Should also work on any midi module with GM drum set.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version tk707-0.4
Changes since tk707-0.3

Feb 16, 2000
	- Added logo

Feb 15, 2000
	- Separated pattern & control queues into their own contexts.

Feb 14, 2000
	- Tap write now working.
	- Added space bar as keyboard shortcut to toggle start/stop.

Feb 13, 2000
	- "tk707 -l" returns list of available port descriptions.
These can be used with -p option if no ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS environment
variable has been set.
	- Added fader controls for midi volume, mapped as per original TR-707.
An "Edit Fader Map" item in the Map menu shows the default mapping of
instruments to fader. It will include the ability to edit the mapping when
I think of a suitable interface for it (the TR-707 couldn't do this). This
will be especially useful when using different instrument sound maps.
	- Added track/pattern play/write status display to MODE window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version tk707-0.3
Changes since tk707-0.2a

Feb 11, 2000
	- Added more track editing features -
		Insert pattern before current measure
		Delete current measure
		Delete rest of track including current measure
	- TEMPO/MEAS button now toggles display of tempo or measure when in
Track mode.

Feb 9, 2000
	- Fixed bug which blocked second queue after 200 events.
	- Added pattern clear after confirmation.

Feb 8, 2000
	- Finished conversion of Tcl<->C command interface to newer Tcl_Obj
based system. This will mean that at least Tcl/Tk 8.0 is required.
	- Added tempo value under tempo dial.
	- Added keypress events for keys 1->0 & q->y to simulate clicks on
note buttons.

Feb 6, 2000
	- Implemented second output queue. This allows immediate output of
events even when there are events buffered in the normal queue,
e.g. while a track is playing, you can "play along" by clicking on the
instrument keys.  (after Takashi Iwai's "How to use two clients in a
single application?" page)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version tk707-0.2a
Changes since tk707-0.2

Feb 6, 2000
	- Added some libs to Makefile which weren't being included  by
default in some systems.
	- Added tempo Meta Event to beginning of track during MFF output,
which then highlighted need to correct how note timings are set.
