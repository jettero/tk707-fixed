The TK-707 installation requires:
   * C compiler: to compile the source code.
   * TCL/TK version 8.0 or later.  Tested up to TCL/TK 8.3.  Available
     free from <http://www.scriptics.com>
   * Alsa: audio installation (at least version 0.5.0), available free
     from <http://www.alsa-project.org>
   * a sound card supported by Alsa.

   and, at least one of these MIDI renders:
   * an internal MIDI render hardware in your card.
   * an external MIDI module with drum sounds (Tested Roland D-110 and
     TR-707).
   * or any Alsa supported basic sound card together with the 'timidity'
     or the 'iiwusynth' MIDI synthesis software installed.

   Clearly, if you have neither a MIDI card nor an external MIDI module,
you can successfully manage MIDI files by a MIDI software sequencer.
See below.

   So far tested on
   * Linux - Debian 3.0 (kernel 2.4.18) with SB Live !  sound card
   * Linux - Slackware 7.0 (kernel 2.2.14) with ESS1868 sound card
   * Linux - Mandrak (kernel 2.2.13-7mdk)
   * Linux - Redhat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5) with Ensonic 1370 sound card

1 Building 'tk707'
==================

     	configure
     	make

   The program consists of Tcl/Tk for the gui and C code for outputting
the midi data.  The Tcl/Tk code is compiled with the C code.  The
compiled target 'tk707' is a self contained binary.

2 Configure options
===================

During the configuration step, you could also provide to the 'configure'
script some non-standard locations of the Alsa or Tcl/Tk libraries.  On
my Debian 3.0 installation, I use:
     	configure --with-tcl-includes=/usr/include/tcl8.3
   A more general example writes:
     	configure --with-alsa-prefix=/usr/sound/lib \
     	  --with-alsa-inc-prefix=/usr/sound/include \
     	  --with-tcl-includes=/new/include   --with-tcl-libs=/usr/new/lib  \
     	  --with-tk-includes=/usr/new/include --with-tk-libs=/usr/new/lib
     	make

   Enter 'configure --help' for a complete list of available options.

   It could also be useful to send compiler options to the 'configure'
script.
     	CFLAGS="-O0" configure
     	make
   Indeed, by default, 'gcc' compiler optimization flags are set to the
maximum, i.e '-O9'.  This is not supported for old 'gcc' versions, where
this feature failed on some combinations of Linux kernel versions and
'gcc' version (e.g.  Mandrake with kernel 'Linux-2.2.13-7mdk' and
'pgcc-2.91.66').  Either update our environment or use lower
optimization flags.

3 Installation
==============

     	make install

   The default installation directory is '/usr/local/bin' but this can
be changed by using an extra configuration option:

     	configure --prefix=/users/angela/music
     	make install

   will build and install 'tk707' into the installation directory
'/users/angela/music/bin' as 'tk707'.

4 Running
=========

If installation was done as in previous step, and assuming the
installation directory is in your execution path, then the program is
started with

     	tk707

   A sample song is in 'demo.dat' which can be loaded from the
'File->Load Demo' menu.  After loading, click the <START> button and you
should hear something if your hardware is set up correctly.

   When 'tk707' is first started, a suitable output port needs to be
selected.  A selection gui comes up before the main TK-707 window to
make this choice.  The list on the right hand side should contain one or
more entries from which to choose (don't worry about the input port list
on the left).  Double click on the available output port you want to
use, and it should be entered into the Selected Output box near the
bottom.  Now you can click on the OK button to use the selected output
port for this invocation of TK-707.  You can also click the SAVE button
first to save this information (in '~/.tk707rc') so that you don't need
to make the selection next time you run TK-707.  Note that '~/.tk707rc'
is a plain text file which can be edited by hand if you want to.

   Alternatively, if you know what port you want to use, run 'tk707'
with the '-p' option, e.g.
     	tk707 -p 65:0

   Use of the '-p' option overrides any setting in the '~/.tk707rc'
file.

   A list of suitable ports can also be obtained with the '-l' option,
e.g.
     	tk707 -l

5 Building the documentation
============================

The documentation in '.info' format, suitable for emacs, is contained in
the distribution.  You can browse it:
     	info -f tk707.info

   If you have the 'texi2html' tool, the 'html' version has been
generated during the installation:
     	netscape tk707_toc.html

   If you have TeX installed, a pretty version of the documentation is
available:
     	make dvi
     	xdvi tk707.dvi

   and also for printing:
     	dvips tk707.dvi -o tk707.ps
     	lpr tk707.ps

   Now, read the documentation and enjoy 'tk707'.

6 Comments, bug corrections and future versions
===============================================

We are keen for people to try it and send comments and suggestions.

   Please, send comments, corrections, additions, bugs etc..  to
<chris@vislab.usyd.edu.au> and <pierre.saramito@imag.fr>

7 My card has no midi render...
===============================

Don't worry, you are able to hear midi file with a basic audio sound
card: the 'timidity' code is able to provides an Alsa sequencer
interface which receives events and plays it in real-time.

   'timidity' is a public domain code available at
<http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity>.

   On this mode, 'timidity' works purely as software (real-time) midi
render.  There is no scheduling routine in this interface, since all
scheduling is done by Alsa sequencer core.

   So, download 'timidity' (at least version 2.10.0) and install as
follow:
             configure --enable-server --enable-alsaseq --enable-alsatest \
     		--enable-audio=alsa,wav,au,aiff,list,oss
     	make install

   'timidity' software emulates the best sound cards.  It requires some
Gravis Ultra Sound (GUS) patches describing musical instruments.  The
public domain EAW sound patch suite can be downloaded at
<http://www.stardate.bc.ca/eawpatches/html/default.htm> This his a
complete and high quality library, updated frequently.  Especially,
download the 'gsdrums' percussion instrument library.

   Install these files in the 'timidity' directory, usually
'/usr/share/timidity'.

   For invoking Alsa sequencer interface, run 'timidity' as follows:
           timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os1l -s 44100 &

   The fragment size can be adjustable.  The smaller number gives better
real-time response.  Then 'timidity' shows new port numbers which were
newly created (128:0 and 128:1 below).

   Finally, run 'tk707':
           tk707 -p 128:0

   The 'timidity' render is very flexible and rich, since you can add
any instrument in your library by using SF2 or GUS patch files.  This
modular approach is not always supported by all midi card hardware
renders.  Thus, the software MIDI render solution is fruitful, and could
be installed, even if you have a hardware or external MIDI solution.
